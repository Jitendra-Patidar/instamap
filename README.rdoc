Current ongoing Rails app. Instamap will be the first featured side project I am currently building out. Currently the app uses Google maps and Instagram API.

Things to do
-------------
1. Look into FB, Twitter, Four Square, Yelp API to see if it is possible to extract geolocations to create heat maps for a particular user.
2. Build out profile pages for each Instagram user.
3. Clean up code base and learn more JavaScript/jQuery.
4. Commit to the inital goal of 1k FB likes.
5. Future planning....
